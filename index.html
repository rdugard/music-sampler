<p>Drums blast out of speakers while a guitar riff pierces your ears, everyone wears black bandanas obscuring their faces, and a pit has opened up only to be filled with people wildly running and swinging their arms. Here plays Crown the Empire, the music that could spark fuel a revolution. With four albums since 2011, they have gained quite the following. My, do they have a flare for the dramatic. The first three albums <em>Limitless</em>, <em>The Fallout</em>, and <em>The Resistance: Rise of the Runaways</em>, tell a story of someone named Johnny who died, traded his soul for life, got trapped in hell and then took over hell. Resisting the system is a popular topic even though the album <em>Retrograde</em> is a bit more relaxed with the theme of outer space and the possibility of aliens. If you like hardcore screaming music, here are some samples to get you hooked.</p>
